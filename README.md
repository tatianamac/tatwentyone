Welcome! This is the staging grounds for the future tatianamac.com.

I seek to build this all in the open with the following principles:

## Principles

- Performance: I'll only use what I need and load it responsibly.
- Accessibility: I'll make this work for as many people as possible.
- Consent: I'll ask permission for my user's preferences.
- Teaching: I'll document what I learn to pay it forward.
